# Healthcare_Mental_Health-Analysis
## Tableau Dashboard and Sql queries for Mental Health across the world

This project is aimed at gaining insights on mental health consisting of 5 factors
- Depression
- Eating Disorder
- Anxiety Disorder
- Bipolar Disorder
- Schizophrenia 

The link for the datast is https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/burden-disease-from-each-mental-illness

## Tools used
- SQL server
- Tableau
- SSMS


After importing data in SQL, Queries were fired to get data for :
- YoY change for different countries across the world from 1990 to 2019
- Percentage change in the number of cases reported
-  Number of distinct countries in the dataset
- Getting data based on specific country and year
- Top and bottom performers based on the parameters 
- Top and bottom performers based on the Year
- Top 5th Region based on the parameters.

 Queries can be refrenced [here](https://github.com/RimpleDabas/Healthcare_Mental_Health-Analysis/blob/main/SQLQueries.sql).

 After getting the results for comparison, next step involved creating dashboard on Tableau which allows the user to toggle between 3 navigation buttons:
 - To see yearly trends 
 - To make comparisons globally
 - To add and make comparisons on countries of choice

- For Schizophrenia acknowledge the burden in developed nations and prioritize community-based care.Advocate for research funding to improve understanding and treatment

Regional Considerations:

- In African countries reporting high depression rates, invest in mental health infrastructure.
